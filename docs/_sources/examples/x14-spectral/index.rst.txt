========================================

Sound processing in the spectral domain.

**FFT**

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and its inverse (IFFT).

**Phase Vocoder**

The phase vocoder is a digital signal processing technique of potentially great musical significance.
It can be used to perform very high fidelity time scaling, pitch transposition, and myriad other modifications of sounds.

Although the following examples are built by hand with raw FFT objects, for educational purposes, most of these
processes (and more) are implemented, with greater efficiency, with the Phase Vocoder algorithm. You should
really take a look at the different PV object's examples in the documentation.
