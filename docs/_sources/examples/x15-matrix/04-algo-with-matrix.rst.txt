============================================================================================================================================


This script demonstrates how to use a matrix to do some algorithmic generation of notes.

.. code-block:: python

    from pyo import *
    
    s = Server(duplex=0, audio="jack").boot()
    
    # Matrix of 4 rows of 4 MIDI notes each.
    mat = [
        [36, 41, 43, 48],
        [48, 51, 53, 57],
        [60, 62, 67, 68],
        [70, 72, 74, 77]
    ]
    
    notes = NewMatrix(4, 4, mat)
    
    # X position is chosen randomly (2 audio streams for a stereo output).
    x = RandInt(max=4, freq=[4, 8], mul=0.25)
    
    # Y position is a simple metronomic count from 0 to 3 (again 2 audio streams).
    met = Metro(time=[0.5, 1]).play()
    y = Counter(input=met, min=0, max=4, mul=0.25)
    
    # Pick MIDI notes in the matrix.
    midi = MatrixPointer(matrix=notes, x=x, y=y)
    
    # Converts MIDI notes to frequencies.
    freq = [MToF(midi[0] - 12), MToF(midi[1])]
    
    # Simple synthesizer.
    synth = LFO(freq=freq, sharp=0.75, type=2, mul=0.25)
    chorus = Chorus(synth).out()
    
    s.gui(locals())
