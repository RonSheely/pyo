"""
03-fft-morphing.py - Performs the spectral morphing of two sounds.

The FFT object analyses an input signal and converts it into the
spectral domain. Three audio signals are sent out of the object,
the real part, from bin 0 (DC) to bin size/2 (Nyquist frequency),
the imaginary part, from bin 0 to bin size/2-1, and the bin number,
an increasing count from 0 to size-1.

This script performs the spectral morphing of two sounds, by multiplying the
magnitudes, and adding the phases of both sounds.

For a simpler and more efficient process, see the Phase Vocoder
implementation of the spectral morphing: `PVMorph`.
